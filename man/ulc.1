.SH NAME
ulc \- Husky Fido Userlist Compiler
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B ulc
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B ulc
is the Husky Fido Userlist Compiler. ulc reads all nodelists that are
configured in Fidoconfig (via the "nodelist" keyword) and creates the
FIDOUSER.LST file (the name has to be configured with the "fidouserlist"
keyword). ulc does not take any command line options; it uses fidoconfig
to determine where to find the nodelist files. A log file named
"nltools.log" is placed in the fidoconfig log file directory.

The FIDOUSER.LST file format is defined as follows: The file consists of
text records of fixed length (65 characters including the terminal \\r\\n
sequence). The name of the sysop is left-aligned in the line in reverse
order (e.g. "Tobias_Ernst" would become "Ernst, Tobias"). Aligned to the
right of the record is the node number of the user. The records are sorted
alphabetically, so that a program can use a binary search algorithm to
find the corresponding node number for a given user name very fast.

The FIDOUSER.LST file format is supported by many mail readers, e.g. Timed
and Msged. For Msged, FIDOUSER.LST is currently the best method to
implement a node lookup at all, because Msged's V7 routines are flawed.
