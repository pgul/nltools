max (patch from Serguei Revtov):
- change legacy SUN makefile to compile with new includes, simplifying

Mo   7 Feb 2000 00:07:24 CET
tobi:
- Nodediff and -list update files were not rejected if they contained an
  invalid header line (even though this invalid line was detected).

So   2 Jan 2000 11:28:26 CET
tobi:
- When nldiff was invoked with a nodediff filename that had the same
  extension as the nodelist filename (obviously an user error) and the -n
  parameter was given, the original nodelist was deleted. Fixed.

Tue Dec 28 21:39:50 MET 1999
tobi:
- Fixed bug on Unix that could, in the situation that a nodelist and two 
  consequent nodediffs were found, lead to the situation that only the
  first nodediff was applied, but not the second one. (On a consecutive
  run, though, of course the second one was also applied).

ml:
- Removed some unnecessary variables
- Added makefile for Watcom C for Windows

Tue 30 Nov 1999 22:10:01 CET
sms:
- fixed some misuses of ++ in ulcomp.c
(Remark by TE: I don't think those caused any problems, they were both
 ANSI and K&R proofed)

Wed Oct 13 10:31:36 MET DST 1999
mtt:
- fixed typo in linux makefile
- added sun makefile
- removed nldiff binary :-)

Mo  11 Okt 1999 00:20:20 CEST
- Fixed the sort routine. It was buggy and slow, so I replaced it with
  the brute force method (read everything into RAM) until I find time to
  do it better.
- added Points24 support
- revised documentation

Fri Oct  8 19:31:06 MET DST 1999 (tobi)
- first version in CVS
- contains nldiff, nlcrc, ulc
- ulc is still very slow due to broken sort routine
- nlupdate still missing
